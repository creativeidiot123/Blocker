## 📖 Overview

Blocker is a robust Android application engineered to help you reclaim your time and focus. Whether you are studying, working, or simply trying to reduce screen time, Blocker enforces strict app restrictions to keep you on track.

*   **🛡️ Uninstall & Modification Protection:** Employs Device Admin privileges and Accessibility guards to prevent unauthorized uninstallation or tampering with the app's settings.
*   **🎨 Material You 3 Design:** A stunning, modern, and expressive user interface that adapts to your device's Monet color palette for a seamless, native experience.

## ⚙️ Required Permissions

For Blocker to function correctly and provide its strict blocking capabilities, it requires the following elevated permissions:

*   **Accessibility Service:** Used aggressively to detect when a blocked app is launched (even in floating windows) and immediately close it. Also used to prevent users from force-stopping or uninstalling Blocker from Android Settings.
*   **Device Administrator:** Used as a secondary layer of protection to prevent the app from being uninstalled without authorization.
*   **Draw Over Other Apps (Overlay):** Required to display the "Blocked" screen over applications you are trying to restrict.

*Note: Blocker respects your privacy. It does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. It operates entirely offline on your device.*
